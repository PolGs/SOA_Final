# SOA Final - Q2 2022 SOA Project

The respectable professor Baka Baka wants to implement a video game on our Zeos system. He would
like to design a snake-like game in which a snake must eat food that appears randomly in the screen
avoiding collisions with itself and the borders of the screen. The more food the snake eats, the larger it
becomes. Unfortunately, Zeos currently does not provide the necessary device access support (keyboard
and screen)

## Build


```bash
make
gcc -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -o build build.c
./build bootsect system.out user.out > zeos.bin
```

## Usage

```python

```
